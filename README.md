# Python_Quiz_App
Created a Python Quiz App that reads questions and answers from a text file. The game ends if an incorrect answer is given, providing feedback and the score. Implemented exception handling to manage file errors and ensure smooth runtime. Enhanced my skills in file handling and exception management in Python!
