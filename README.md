# 🧠 Python Quiz App

A simple **Python-based Quiz Application** that allows users to test their knowledge with multiple-choice questions. This project uses **file handling** and **exception handling** techniques to read questions from a file and manage user inputs effectively.

## 📌 Features

- Load quiz questions from a file
- Multiple-choice questions with user input
- Tracks and displays the user's score
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs
- Console-based interface (easy to run and use)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- File Handling
- Exception Handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HafsaNoorMuhammad26/Python_Quiz_App.git
   cd Python_Quiz_App
````

2. Make sure the `questions.txt` file (or any quiz file) is available in the project directory.

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python quiz_app.py
   ```

## 📁 File Structure

```
Python_Quiz_App/
├── quiz_app.py       # Main script to run the quiz
├── questions.txt     # Text file containing quiz questions and options
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## 📝 Sample Format of `questions.txt`

```
Question text?
A) Option A
B) Option B
C) Option C
D) Option D
Answer: B
```

Ensure each question block follows the same structure in the file.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

* Working with files (`open`, `read`, `with` statement)
* Using try-except blocks to catch user input errors
* Conditional logic and loops
* String manipulation

## 🎯 Future Improvements

* GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
* Score tracking with high scores saved to file
* Timed quizzes
* Randomized questions and options
